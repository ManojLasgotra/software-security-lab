**Software Security Laboratory:**
A comprehensive portfolio of security experiments, vulnerability analysis, and defensive implementations.

**Project Overview:**
This repository serves as a technical log for the Software Security (SS) Lab. It documents the identification of critical vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) and the implementation of industry-standard security controls.

**Experiment Index:**
1. Code Vulnerability Analysis
Objective: Identify basic security flaws in C and Python.
Vulnerabilities: Buffer Overflows, Insecure Input Handling, and Hardcoded Credentials.
Methodology: Manual Code Walkthroughs and Static Analysis.

2. Input-Based Attacks & Mitigations
Objective: Simulate SQL Injection (SQLi) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Countermeasure: Implementation of input validation and sanitization.
Platforms: DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) / Local Web Apps.

3. Cryptographic Hashing & Secure Storage
Objective: Experiment with hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA-256).
Focus: Implementing password storage using Hashing + Salting in Python.

4. Secure Code Review: Login Systems
Objective: Audit a login module for insecure coding practices.
Findings: Identifying plain-text passwords and missing input length checks.

5. Network Traffic Capture & Inspection
Objective: Use packet capture tools to observe HTTP transmissions.
Focus: Identifying plaintext vulnerabilities and sensitive headers using Wireshark or tcpdump.

6. Threat Modeling (STRIDE)
Objective: Design and analyze a threat model for a web application.
Methodology: Applying the STRIDE framework (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, DoS, Elevation of Privilege).

7. Authentication Mechanisms
Objective: Develop a secure login form with backend hashed password verification.
Focus: Demonstrating how modern, secure authentication workflows function.

8. Vulnerability Scanning
Objective: Automated security testing of web applications.
Tools: OWASP ZAP (Passive Scan Mode) to detect outdated software and misconfigurations.

9. Browser Artifact Inspection
Objective: Understand user tracking and privacy risks.
Focus: Exploring history, cookies, and saved session data using Browser Developer Tools.

10. Incident Response Simulation
Objective: Identify suspicious activities from system access logs.
Outcome: Detecting brute-force attempts and drafting professional incident reports.

Tech Stack & Tools:
Languages: C, Python, SQL
Network Analysis: Wireshark, tcpdump
Web Security: OWASP ZAP, DVWA
Methodologies: STRIDE Threat Modeling, Static Code Analysis
